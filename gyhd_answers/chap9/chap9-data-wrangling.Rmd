**Getting your hands dirty**

It's time to practice! This exercise begins in Chapter 6 and continues through Chapter 9. This exercise is therefore divided into 4 parts. For this exercise, you'll work with a csv file available on [Github](https://github.com/warint/DPR){target="_blank"} in the *chapter6* folder.

Now, let's begin with the last part of this exercise:

* **Step 6 : Merging datasets**

Join the data frame "locations" to the data frame "gdp3".

```{r, eval=FALSE}
gdp4 <- left_join(gdp3, locations, c("country"))
```
