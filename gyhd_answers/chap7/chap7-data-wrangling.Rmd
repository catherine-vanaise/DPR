**Getting your hands dirty**

It's time to practice! This exercise begins in Chapter 6 and continues through Chapter 9. This exercise is therefore divided into 4 parts. For this exercise, you'll work with a csv file available on [Github](https://github.com/warint/DPR){target="_blank"} in the *chapter6* folder.

Now, let's begin with the second part of this exercise:

* **Step 3 : Delete the column**

Delete the column "X1".

```{r, eval=FALSE}
gdp$X1 <- NULL
```

* **Step 4 : Filter the data**

Filter the data to only keep the following countries: "United States", "Canada", "Japan", "Belgium" and "France".

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
gdp2 <- filter(gdp, country == "United States" | country == "Canada" | country == "Japan" | country == "Belgium" | country == "France")
```
