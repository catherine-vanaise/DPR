**Getting your hands dirty**

It's time to practice! This exercise begins in Chapter 6 and continues through Chapter 9. This exercise is therefore divided into 4 parts. For this exercise, you'll work with a csv file available on [Github](https://github.com/warint/DPR){target="_blank"} in the *chapter6* folder.

Let's begin with the first part of this exercise!

* **Step 1 : Import via a csv**

Import the csv file called "chapter6data.csv".

```{r}
library(readr)
gdp <- read_csv("./chapter6data.csv")
```

* **Step 2 : Import via a gsheet** 

Import a dataset containing longitude and latitude from this gsheet: <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nehKEBKTQx11LZuo5ZJFKTVS0p5y1ysMPSOSX_m8dS8/edit?usp=sharing>

```{r}
library(gsheet)
locations <- gsheet2tbl("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nehKEBKTQx11LZuo5ZJFKTVS0p5y1ysMPSOSX_m8dS8/edit?usp=sharing")
```
